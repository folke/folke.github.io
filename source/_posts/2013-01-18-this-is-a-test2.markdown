Testing *Octopress* boo haaa.

This article is a summary of a 3 fast and easy CSS techniques you can use to display only a portion of an image in your content. All techniques explained here actually need only couple of lines of CSS. However, it is not cropping in a real sense of the word, we are not cutting the image down to a certain size (CSS can’t do that yet) we are merely hiding the "extra" and displaying only a part of the image we want. That’s why I call it Faux Image Cropping.
These techniques can be very helpful if you need to keep images at a certain size, i.e. thumbnails in the news section or something similar. Being able to use CSS to control which portion of image to display is a great bonus.
